## Description (For Job Applications/Outside Viewers)
This was a group project I (Colby Porter), Kenta Yoshii, Keigo Hachisuka, and Grace Chen completed for CSCI1951A: Data Science, a course in Brown University's computer science department. For our project, we decided to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 cases and Uber prices in Chicago.  

To understand the project, I recommend first reading the abstract (linked below), which contains an overview of all parts of the project. 

This project was highly collaborative, and all overall design choices were made as a group. Choosing the topic, finding the data, deciding on data structuring, model choice, and final analysis were all completed together. Coding for individual components as well as writing for the reports was completed separately for efficiency reasons. The portions I completed are:
- Hypothesis testing, found in final_deliverable/code/hypotheses.py
- KMeans + SVM analysis, found in final_deliverable/code/kmeans_svm.py
- Parts of the preprocessing and visualizations found in final_deliverable/code/preprocess.py and final_deliverable/code/viz.py
- Parts of the tech report, abstract, and poster
